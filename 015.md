# Discrepancy in JumpRateModel Implementation

### Summary

The implementation of the `updateJumpRateModelInternal` function in the `BaseJumpRateModelV2` contract contains a calculation error that affects the `multiplierPerTimestamp`. The current code divides the `multiplierPerTimestamp` by the `kink_` parameter, which is incorrect according to the provided [documentation](https://machfi.gitbook.io/machfi-documentation/protocol/mechanics/interest-rate) and the intended design of the interest rate model. The `kink_` should not influence the calculation of the multiplier directly but is only relevant for determining the threshold where the "jump multiplier" is applied when the utilization rate exceeds the kink.

Although the Compound V2 interest rate model includes `kink_` in the multiplier calculation, this is because Compound uses block-based time measurements (e.g., `blocksPerYear`) instead of timestamps. The Mach Finance protocol uses timestamp-based measurements (`timestampsPerYear`), and its documentation does not support including `kink_` in the multiplier calculation.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is the incorrect formula used for calculating [multiplierPerTimestamp](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-mach-finance/blob/94f707dd94fc13dc0132deaa89c68f53bed306fa/contracts/src/BaseJumpRateModelV2.sol#L156). In the current code:
```solidity
    function updateJumpRateModelInternal(
        uint256 baseRatePerYear,
        uint256 multiplierPerYear,
        uint256 jumpMultiplierPerYear,
        uint256 kink_
    ) internal {
        baseRatePerTimestamp = ((baseRatePerYear * BASE) / timestampsPerYear) / BASE;
@>      multiplierPerTimestamp = (multiplierPerYear * BASE) / (timestampsPerYear * kink_);
        jumpMultiplierPerTimestamp = ((jumpMultiplierPerYear * BASE) / timestampsPerYear) / BASE;
        kink = kink_;

        emit NewInterestParams(baseRatePerTimestamp, multiplierPerTimestamp, jumpMultiplierPerTimestamp, kink);
    }
```
The documentation specifies that the `multiplierPerTimestamp` is derived from the annual multiplier (`multiplierPerYear`) and the timestamps per year (`timestampsPerYear`), and should not be affected by the `kink_` parameter.

The jump rate model calculates the interest for a specific asset by using the utilization rate up to the kink point. When utilization exceeds the `kink_`, the jump multiplier is used, but the multiplier itself should not be modified by kink. The `kink_` is only used to specify the utilization threshold of interest rate growth (**up to the kink and beyond the kink**).

### Impact

This miscalculation leads to incorrect interest rate calculations, as the `multiplierPerTimestamp` is being scaled based on an irrelevant parameter (`kink_`). This error will affect both the borrow and supply rates. The borrow rate calculation depends on the `multiplierPerTimestamp`, and the supply rate is also influenced by these interest rate calculations. As a result, this could distort interest rates, making them higher or lower than intended, potentially disrupting market incentives and leading to inefficient liquidity utilization or rate imbalances.

### Mitigation
Similar to [Moonwell](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/moonwell-contracts-v2/blob/c89962e195df2987f1f6be16ec36ac343d93ea09/src/irm/JumpRateModel.sol#L67-L70), the calculation for `multiplierPerTimestamp` should be based solely on the annual multiplier (`multiplierPerYear`) and the number of timestamps per year (`timestampsPerYear`). The `kink_` parameter should not affect this calculation. As described, the correct formula for `multiplierPerTimestamp` is:
```solidity
multiplierPerTimestamp = ((multiplierPerYear * BASE) / timestampsPerYear) / BASE;
```
