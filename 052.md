# Unsafe casting in the PythOracle.

### Summary

The `pythPrice.price` and `pythPrice.expo` are unsafely cast from `int` to `uint`, which can result in the incorrect price being reported.

### Root Cause

Unsafe casting can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-mach-finance/blob/main/contracts/src/Oracles/Pyth/PythOracle.sol#L100-L101).

The reported `pythPrice.price` can be negative, and the reported `pythPrice.expo` can be positive, as Pyth is able to report such values. 

In any of these situations, the `_getLatestPrice()` function will report a heavily incorrect price.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

- Pyth reports a negative price for any given asset, or the reported `expo` becomes positive.

### Impact

- Loss of funds, as the reported price will be heavily incorrect yet accepted.

### Mitigation

A proper sanity check should be performed to check that the reported price is > 0 and that the exponent is in the desired range. If any of the values are outside the desired ranges, return `(0, 0)` to inform the `PriceOracleAggregator` about the invalid price to use an fallback oracle.

```solidity
        if (pythPrice.price <= 0 || pythPrice.expo > 0) {
            return (0, 0);
        }
```
