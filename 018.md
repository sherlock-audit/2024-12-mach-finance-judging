# All oracles lack staleness checks

### Summary

`PythOracle` contract utilizes `getPriceUnsafe()` method to fetch the price from Pyth. As per Pyth official docs, in contract to the contest README, this function does not guarantee getting an up to date price:
> This function may return a price from arbitrarily far in the past. It is the caller's responsibility to check the returned timestamp to ensure that the update is recent enough for their use case.
^[source](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/api-reference/aptos/get-price-unsafe)
Similarly, API3 and Band oracle prices are not verified in terms of staleness. 

According to the README, no off-chain mechanism ensures that the price is recent.

### Root Cause

`_getLatestPrice()` function does not implement any staleness checks on the returned price in all of the implemented oracles:

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Prices used in `PriceOracleAggregator` will be stale, as the Pyth oracle is the first one in line assuming it does not return `isValid = false`. 

This will lead to bad debt as cTokens will be incorrectly priced presenting an arbitrage opportunity.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Follow [Pyth's best practises](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#price-availability) by implementing staleness checks and/or consider utilizing `getPriceNoOlderThan()` function to ensure extra security. Implement similar checks for all other oracles.
