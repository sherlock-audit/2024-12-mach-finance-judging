# Protocol miscounts the supply cap of cSonic

### Summary

Supply caps are used to prevent oversupply of cTokens; hence, every time cTokens are minted, the supply cap is enforced. However, the cSonic implementation of the supply cap is incorrectly implemented, causing it to not work as intended.

### Root Cause

```solidity
if (supplyCap != 0) {
            uint256 totalCash = CToken(cToken).getCash();
            uint256 totalBorrows = CToken(cToken).totalBorrows();
            uint256 totalReserves = CToken(cToken).totalReserves();
            // totalSupplies = totalCash + totalBorrows - totalReserves
            uint256 totalSupplies = sub_(add_(totalCash, totalBorrows), totalReserves);

            uint256 nextTotalSupplies;

            if (_getUnderlyingAddress(CToken(cToken)) == nativeAsset) {
                // Don't add "mintAmount" since "cToken.getCashPrior()" already includes it (double counting issue)
                nextTotalSupplies = totalSupplies;
            } else {
                nextTotalSupplies = add_(totalSupplies, mintAmount);
            }

            require(nextTotalSupplies < supplyCap, "market supply cap reached");
        }
```

In the code snippet above, if the `cToken` is a native asset, the `mintAmount` is not added, assuming the `msg.value` is already included in the contract balance. However, this assumption is incorrect because the `getCashPrior()` function always subtracts the `msg.value` from `address.balance`.  

```solidity
function getCashPrior() internal view override returns (uint256) {
        return address(this).balance - msg.value;
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

None needed

### External Pre-conditions

None needed

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Protocol can't pretend the over supply of native asset causing markets to overexpose to native asset

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

remove the if check and add the mintAmount just like its done for cToken's.
