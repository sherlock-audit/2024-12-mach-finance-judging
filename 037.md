# Absence of Timestamp Validation in Oracle Price Fetching From API3 Oracle

### Summary

The [_getLatestPrice](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-mach-finance/blob/main/contracts/src/Oracles/API3/API3Oracle.sol#L69) function in the contract does not validate the timestamp returned by the API3 oracle, which could lead to the usage of stale or outdated price data. This can result in incorrect financial operations, such as inaccurate collateral valuations, missed liquidations, or wrong interest accruals, eventually breaking the protocol.

### Root Cause

In API3Oracle.sol: 69, The [_getLatestPrice](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-mach-finance/blob/main/contracts/src/Oracles/API3/API3Oracle.sol#L69) function retrieves the latest price and timestamp from the API3 proxy without verifying the timestamp. If the timestamp is older than a reasonable threshold, the returned price may no longer be accurate or relevant. This lack of validation deviates from API3's recommended integration practices.

This issue is valid because in api3 contract, it is stated; 'This package provides the tools to integrate data feeds that can be found at the API3 Market. The typical workflow is as follows:

Purchase data feed subscriptions and get the respective proxy addresses at the API3 Market
Use the proxy address computation utility function provided by this package (computeCommunalApi3ReaderProxyV1Address()) to validate the proxy addresses being used
Use the proxy contract interfaces provided by this package in the reader contract, as demonstrated in https://github.com/api3dao/data-feed-reader-example'
HERE is the example provided in api3 contract on how integrations should be implemented;
```solidty
function readDataFeed()
        external
        view
        returns (int224 value, uint256 timestamp)
    {
        (value, timestamp) = IApi3ReaderProxy(proxy).read();
        // If you have any assumptions about value and timestamp, make sure
        // to validate them right after reading from the proxy. For example,
        // if the value you are reading is the spot price of an asset, you may
        // want to reject non-positive values...
        require(value > 0, "Value not positive");
        // ...and if the data feed is being updated with a one day-heartbeat
        // interval, you may want to check for that.
        require(
            timestamp + 1 days > block.timestamp,
            "Timestamp older than one day"
        );
        // After validation, you can implement your contract logic here.
```
The API3 example explicitly checks that the returned timestamp is not older than a certain threshold (1 day in the example). Ignoring this check in _getLatestPrice deviates from API3's recommended integration practices.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Code Logic in _getLatestPrice:
No validation is performed on the timestamp returned by the API3 proxy.
Only the price is checked for positivity, leaving stale prices undetected.

```solidity
 function _getLatestPrice(address token) internal view returns (uint256) {
        address proxyAddress = tokenToApi3ProxyAddress[token];
        if (proxyAddress == address(0)) {
            return 0;
        }

        IApi3ReaderProxy api3Proxy = IApi3ReaderProxy(proxyAddress);

        // API3 returns prices with scaled up by 1e18 base
        // https://docs.api3.org/dapps/integration/contract-integration.html#using-value
        (int224 price,) = api3Proxy.read();

        // Ensure price is positive, negative & zero prices are not valid
        if (price <= 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        return uint256(int256(price));
    }
```

### External Pre-conditions

Proxy feeds might not update frequently enough, depending on the configuration or availability of the data feed.


### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Financial loss because of incorrect financial operations, such as inaccurate collateral valuations, missed liquidations, or wrong interest accruals

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure that the timestamp returned by the API3 proxy is recent. Implement a threshold to reject outdated data.
Example Code:
```solidity
function _getLatestPrice(address token) internal view returns (uint256) {
    address proxyAddress = tokenToApi3ProxyAddress[token];
    if (proxyAddress == address(0)) {
        return 0;
    }

    IApi3ReaderProxy api3Proxy = IApi3ReaderProxy(proxyAddress);
    (int224 price, uint256 timestamp) = api3Proxy.read();

    // Ensure price is positive and timestamp is recent
    if (price <= 0 || timestamp + 1 days < block.timestamp) {
        return 0;
    }

    return uint256(int256(price));
}
```
