# Lack of Sanity Check on Price Feed IDs in Constructor

### Summary

The constructor of the `PythOracle` contract initializes price feed mappings for underlying tokens using the provided `_underlyingTokens` and `_priceFeedIds` arrays. However, there is no sanity check to validate the provided `priceFeedId` values. This allows the initialization of invalid or non-existent price feed IDs, which could lead to incorrect or broken price feeds.

### Root Cause

- In `PythOracle.sol:25-37`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-mach-finance/blob/main/contracts/src/Oracles/Pyth/PythOracle.sol#L25-L37
The provided `_priceFeedIds[i]` values are directly assigned without validating if these IDs are valid within the Pyth price feed system. Without validation, the following risks arise:

- An invalid `priceFeedId` can lead to inaccurate or missing price data.
- If the `priceFeedId` does not correspond to an actual feed in the Pyth system, downstream calls that rely on this feed will fail or provide incorrect results.
- It is inconsistent with the `_setPriceFeedId` and `setPriceFeedId` functions, which include a sanity check (`pyth.getPriceUnsafe(priceFeedId)`).

### Impact

1. Inaccurate Price Data: Contracts dependent on the `PythOracle` for accurate pricing will be exposed to risk if an invalid price feed is initialized.
2. Broken System Functionality: Downstream functions relying on valid price feeds will revert or fail if an invalid `priceFeedId` is used.
3. Inconsistent Logic: The constructorâ€™s behavior is inconsistent with the `_setPriceFeedId` and `setPriceFeedId` functions, which enforce validation.

### PoC

### Mitigation

- Introduce a sanity check for each `priceFeedId` during initialization
- Instead of directly assigning priceFeedIds in the constructor, reuse the `_setPriceFeedId` function for consistent validation logic:
