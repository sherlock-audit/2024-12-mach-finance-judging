# Precision loss

# Interest Rate Calculation

Precision loss by accumulating interest over long periods can occur due to the limitations of fixed-point arithmetic in Solidity.

**Interest Rate Precision:**
- When the `borrowRate` is extremely small (e.g., 0.00000001 scaled by 1e18), the `simpleInterestFactor` can become negligible over short time intervals (`timestampDelta`).

**Accumulated Interest:**
- Multiplying `simpleInterestFactor` by `totalBorrows` may result in truncation due to fixed-point arithmetic, particularly when `totalBorrows` is large.

**Effect Over Time:**
- Repeated truncation and rounding can cause cumulative errors, leading to actual interest accrued being slightly less than anticipated. This issue is more significant over extended periods or with frequent interest calculations.

**Practical Impact:**
- **Slight Underestimation:** Borrowers may pay marginally less interest than expected, impacting lender returns.
- **Compound Effect:** Over time, these small discrepancies can accumulate, resulting in noticeable differences between expected and actual financial outcomes.

## Mitigation

Implement a higher precision arithmetic library to handle calculations involving very small interest rates. This can help reduce truncation errors.
