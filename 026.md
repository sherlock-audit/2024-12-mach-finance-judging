# The time validity corresponding to the price information is not checked

### Summary

When obtaining the price in `API3Oracle.sol#L69-L79`, the corresponding time of changing the price is not checked, which may cause the obtained price to have expired.
````function _getLatestPrice(address token) internal view returns (uint256) {
        address proxyAddress = tokenToApi3ProxyAddress[token];
        if (proxyAddress == address(0)) {
            return 0;
        }

        IApi3ReaderProxy api3Proxy = IApi3ReaderProxy(proxyAddress);

        // API3 returns prices with scaled up by 1e18 base
        // https://docs.api3.org/dapps/integration/contract-integration.html#using-value
        (int224 price,) = api3Proxy.read();

### Root Cause

Failure to check the corresponding time when obtaining the price may cause the obtained price to be invalid.

### Internal Pre-conditions

When obtaining the price, the time validity of the returned price is not checked, and invalid price information may be obtained.

### External Pre-conditions


When obtaining the price, the validity of the corresponding time of the price information was not checked.

### Attack Path

Failure to check the time of this price information when obtaining price information may cause the obtained price information to be invalid.

### Impact

When users obtain price information, it may cause the price information to be invalid.

### PoC

        address proxyAddress = tokenToApi3ProxyAddress[token];

        IApi3ReaderProxy api3Proxy = IApi3ReaderProxy(proxyAddress);

It is recommended to change the code `(int224 price,) = api3Proxy.read();` to
````(int224 price,uint256 timestamp) = api3Proxy.read();
        if(block.timestamp - 24 * 60 * 60 > timestamp) {
            revert("stale price, more than 24 hours old");
        }
