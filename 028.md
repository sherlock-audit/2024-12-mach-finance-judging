# Pyth oracle does not validate the freshness of price

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-mach-finance/blob/main/contracts/src/Oracles/Pyth/PythOracle.sol#L98

the price oracle uses getPriceUnsafe which according to the pyth docs 
https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/troubleshoot/evm#getprice-reverts-with-staleprice-or-0x19abf40e-error
Another method to fetch the price is getPriceUnsafe() If the price feed is available, the method will return the latest prices with timestamp of last update. NOTE: getPriceUnsafe() method does not check the freshness of the price.

this could mean that old prices could be gotten from the pyth oracle since there is no logic to check whether the price is fresh or not
