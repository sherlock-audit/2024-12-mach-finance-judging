# The project does not support price updating for Pyth Oracle

## Summary

Not updating Pyth Oracle prices exposes the protocol to reliance on third-party actors.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Pyth is a [pull oracle](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/pull-updates) which means, it relies on the price feed users to fetch price from offchain providers and update it in the Pyth Network.

>With a pull oracle, applications need to update the on-chain price before reading it.

However, this is not implemented in the `PythOracle.sol` contract, meaning it relies on other parties to update prices. As a result, price feeds may not be actively or regularly updated by other users on the Sonic network.

## Impact

Relying on unknown and untrusted third parties to keep Pyth price feeds up to date unnecessarily exposes the protocol to the risk of operating on stale prices or prices being updated only when it is profitable for a user.

## Code Snippet

## Recommendation

Implement updating feed prices as per the Pyth documentation https://api-reference.pyth.network/price-feeds/evm/updatePriceFeeds.
