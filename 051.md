# PythOracle does not verify the confidence interval.

### Summary

The price data returned from Pyth includes a confidence interval. Refer to the Pyth documentation [here](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#confidence-intervals) for more details.

Due to the fact that PythOracle uses the `getPriceUnsafe()` function to retrieve the latest reported price and the fact that Pyth prices can be updated by anyone, an attacker can update already fresh data with a new price that has a larger confidence interval. 

From Pyth perspective, such a price is not invalid because the confidence interval is part of the reported price. It is the user responsibility to confirm that the given confidence level is sufficient.

As such, a price with high uncertainty can be used by a malicious actor to inflate or deflate a currently fresh and certain price. This could force the liquidation of any user whose position is close to crossing the liquidation shortfall.

### Root Cause

The confidence interval of the reported price is not properly validated, and any given price is accepted as valid. [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-mach-finance/blob/main/contracts/src/Oracles/Pyth/PythOracle.sol#L93-L104)

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

- A fresh but not confident price is available, which can be used to update the Pyth price feed.

### Impact

- A borrower position can be force-liquidated based on a highly uncertain price.

### Mitigation

Consider utilizing the confidence interval provided by the Pyth price feed, as recommended in the official documentation. This approach helps mitigate the risk of users exploiting invalid prices.

```solidity
        if (pythPrice.conf > uint64(pythPrice.price) * maxConfWidth / BASIS_POINTS) {
            return (0, 0);
        }
