# `API3Oracle::getPrice` may return stale price

### Summary

`API3Oracle::getPrice` doesn't check for stale prices

### Root Cause

The `API3Oracle::getPrice` function is used to get the price of a token from API3 proxy, which calls the `_getLatestPrice` function to get the price information:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-mach-finance/blob/main/contracts/src/Oracles/API3/API3Oracle.sol#L77-L79

```solidity
/**
 */
/**
 * @notice Gets the latest price for a token from the API3 proxy
 * @dev Returns 0 if the token has no proxy address configured or if the price is not positive
 * @param token The address of the token to get the price for
 * @return price token price in USD with 18 decimals of precision
 */
function _getLatestPrice(address token) internal view returns (uint256) {
    address proxyAddress = tokenToApi3ProxyAddress[token];
    if (proxyAddress == address(0)) {
        return 0;
    }

    IApi3ReaderProxy api3Proxy = IApi3ReaderProxy(proxyAddress);

    // API3 returns prices with scaled up by 1e18 base
    // https://docs.api3.org/dapps/integration/contract-integration.html#using-value
    (int224 price,) = api3Proxy.read(); // @audit: No check on timestamp expiration

    // Ensure price is positive, negative & zero prices are not valid
    if (price <= 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    return uint256(int256(price));
}
```

However, calling `api3Proxy.read();` in the `_getLatestPrice` function only obtains the price but not the timestamp corresponding to the price, nor does it check whether the timestamp is expired, which may result in obtaining expired price information.

### Attack Path

### Impact

Code will execute with prices that donâ€™t reflect the current pricing resulting in a potential loss of funds for users.

### Mitigation

According to the document description:

https://docs.api3.org/dapps/integration/contract-integration.html#using-timestamp

> In general, the only acceptable use of timestamp is validating if the heartbeat interval is upheld, as in require(timestamp + 24 hours > block.timestamp). However, unless your contract design specifically relies on the data feed value being at most a day old (which is unlikely), we do not necessarily recommend this either.

When using the `read` function to obtain the price, you need to obtain the `timestamp`, and check the `timestamp` and `heartbeat interval` to determine whether the current price is stale price.
Consider adding a check similar to the following:
