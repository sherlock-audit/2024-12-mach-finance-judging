# `borrowRateMaxMantissa` was not adjusted after switching from `block.number` to `block.timestamp`.

### Summary

The original `borrowRateMaxMantissa` is set to `0.0005e16`, translating to a maximum borrow rate of 0.0005% per block. (This value was calculated assuming an average block time of 15 seconds.)

Since Mach now uses 1-second intervals, the unchanged `borrowRateMaxMantissa` permits a borrow rate that is 15 times higher than originally intended.

### Root Cause

The `borrowRateMaxMantissa` [(here)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-mach-finance/blob/main/contracts/src/CTokenInterfaces.sol#L31) was not adjusted for the new Sonic chain, specifically the use of `block.timestamp` in place of `block.number`. As a result, it allows for borrow rates up to 15 times higher than designed.

### Impact

- Borrowers may experience borrow rates up to 15 times higher than those originally intended in Compound v2.

### Mitigation

Adjust the `borrowRateMaxMantissa` to reflect the use of `block.timestamp` or acknowledge that this behavior is expected.
