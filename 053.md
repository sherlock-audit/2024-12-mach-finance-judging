# Pyth oracle `conf` is not validated

### Summary

The prices provided by the Pyth network come with a degree of uncertainty which is expressed as a confidence interval around the given price values. Considering a provided price `p`, its confidence interval `Ïƒ` is roughly the standard deviation of the price's probability distribution. From the [official docs of Pyth](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#confidence-intervals), it's best to check the confidence interval to make sure the deviation is expected.


### Root Cause

Confidence level for the returnt price from Pyth is not validated as recommended by the Pyth best practices.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None needed

### External Pre-conditions

1. Price confidence level is low

### Attack Path

If the returnt price confidence level is too low, the protocol will accept the price and function without failing. However, since the confidence level of the price is low, the price should be ignored and only accepted if the confidence level is in correct range.

### Impact

Wrong price can be utilized to price assets which can lead to premature liquidations, over borrowing or under collateralization.

### PoC

None needed

### Mitigation

Check the confidence level as suggested in Pyth original docs
