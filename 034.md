# Confidence intervals of Pyth Oracle prices are ignored

## Summary

The prices in Pyth Network have an important parameter, the 'confidence interval'. Ignoring it may result in invalid prices.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Pyth [documentation](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#confidence-intervals) suggests some ways to leverage confidence intervals to avoid relying on prices that come with an increased level of uncertainty and thus could be invalid at the given moment of time.

However, this is completely ignored in the `PythOracle.sol` contract.

## Impact

The contract accepts any price even if its likelihood of validity is low.

## Code Snippet

## Recommendation

Implement the logic with threshold-based checks to ensure the confidence level meets at least the minimum acceptable value.
