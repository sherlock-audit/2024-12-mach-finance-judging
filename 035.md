# `API3Oracle` may return expired prices

### Summary

The API3 price oracle referenced by the project returns `(int224 value, uint32 timestamp)`, but the project only receives value as price, but ignores the reception and processing of timestamp, which may result in an expired price when obtaining prices through the API3 price oracle.
The recommended way is to add `require(timestamp + 24 hours > block.timestamp)`, which is the recommended processing method in the API3 price oracle documentation referenced by the project. (https://docs.api3.org/dapps/integration/contract-integration.html#using-timestamp)

### Root Cause

In `API3Oracle.sol:79` (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-mach-finance/blob/main/contracts/src/Oracles/API3/API3Oracle.sol#L79), the reception and processing of timestamp is missing

### Internal Pre-conditions

Any price acquisition operation in the project may obtain expired prices, which may lead to abnormal price calculation results and cause financial losses.

### External Pre-conditions

Any price acquisition operation in the project may obtain expired prices, which may lead to abnormal price calculation results and cause financial losses.

### Attack Path

Any price acquisition operation in the project may obtain expired prices, which may lead to abnormal price calculation results and cause financial losses.

### Impact

Any price acquisition operation in the project may obtain expired prices, which may lead to abnormal price calculation results and cause financial losses.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add `require(timestamp + 24 hours > block.timestamp)` in `API3Oracle::_getLatestPrice`
