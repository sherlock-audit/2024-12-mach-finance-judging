# Market may not increase total reserves during times of high volume/frequent transactions

## Summary

The issue arises from the fact that rate variables are set on a per-second basis, and the `accrualBlockTimestamp` variable is updated (i.e., the interest accrual window moves forward) even if no interest is added due to precision loss.


## Vulnerability Detail

In the `BaseJumpRateModelV2.sol`, `multiplierPerTimestamp` is divided by `timestampsPerYear` to calculate the multiplier per second. Considering that `baseRatePerYear` is likely to have the same or similar values as in the Compound v2 protocol, this timestamp-based calculation results in values approximately 15 times lower compared to the original "block-per-year" formula.

```solidity
    function updateJumpRateModelInternal(
        uint256 baseRatePerYear,
        uint256 multiplierPerYear,
        uint256 jumpMultiplierPerYear,
        uint256 kink_
    ) internal {
        baseRatePerTimestamp = ((baseRatePerYear * BASE) / timestampsPerYear) / BASE;
>>      multiplierPerTimestamp = (multiplierPerYear * BASE) / (timestampsPerYear * kink_);
        jumpMultiplierPerTimestamp = ((jumpMultiplierPerYear * BASE) / timestampsPerYear) / BASE;
        kink = kink_;

        emit NewInterestParams(baseRatePerTimestamp, multiplierPerTimestamp, jumpMultiplierPerTimestamp, kink);
    }
```

These lower values, combined with the fact that the Sonic network produces at least 1 block per second, make the Machi protocol more prone to precision loss. This issue is particularly significant during high-frequency interactions with the protocol, as these trigger `CToken.accrueInterest` calculations each time.

Particularly in `CToken.accrueInterest()`, the value to add to reserves is calculated as the interest accumulated multiplied by the reserve factor. The reserve factor is expected to have a value less than 1e18, as it represents the percentage of interest that must be allocated to reserves.

```solidity
        uint256 totalReservesNew =
            mul_ScalarTruncateAddUInt(Exp({mantissa: reserveFactorMantissa}), interestAccumulated, reservesPrior);
```

This can lead to truncation and result in zero if the interest accumulated between subsequent calls to `accrueInterest` is too low, resulting in just a few wei.

For example, the reserve factor for cWBTC in the Compound v2 protocol is 0.3 ([link](https://etherscan.io/address/0xccF4429DB6322D5C611ee964527D42E5d685DD6a#readProxyContract#F20)). This means that if the interest accumulated is less than 4 wei, the result will be zero due to truncation: `3 wei * 0.3 = 0.9 => 0`.

## PoC

Consider the cWBTC market with the following parameters:

1 SONIC = 1 USD
1 WBTC  = 100,000 USD

totalCash: 100 WBTC (or 10,000,000 USD)
reserveFactor: 0.3
multiplierPerYear: 0.25e18
utilizationRate: 5%

Total borrows: 5 WBTC.

Insert this test into `CToken.t.sol`:

```solidity
function test_accrueInterest_PoC() public {
    vm.prank(admin);
    cWbtcDelegator._setReserveFactor(300000000000000000); // 0.3

    uint256 wBTCInitialBalance = 100 * (10 ** wbtc.decimals());
    deal(address(wbtc), bob, wBTCInitialBalance);

    // Supply wBTC as collateral
    vm.startPrank(bob);
    wbtc.approve(address(cWbtcDelegator), type(uint256).max);
    cWbtcDelegator.mint(wBTCInitialBalance);
    vm.stopPrank();

    uint aliceCollateral = 1 * 1e6 ether;
    deal(alice, aliceCollateral);

    // deposit and enter market
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    cSonic.mintAsCollateral{value: aliceCollateral}();

    // Fetch initial liquidity and shortfall
    (, uint256 liquidity, uint256 shortfall) = comptroller.getAccountLiquidity(alice);
    // console.log("Initial liquidity/shortfall    :", liquidity, shortfall);

    // Fetch wBTC price
    uint wbtcPrice = priceOracle.getUnderlyingPrice(CToken(address(cWbtcDelegator)));
    uint borrowableWBTC = (liquidity * 1e36) / wbtcPrice / 1e18;

    // Borrow max wBTC
    cWbtcDelegator.borrow(borrowableWBTC);

    uint utilizationRate = (cWbtcDelegator.totalBorrows() * 1e18) / (cWbtcDelegator.totalBorrows() + cWbtcDelegator.getCash());
    console.log("Utilization Rate (%)            :", utilizationRate * 100 / 1e18);

    uint totalReserves = cWbtcDelegator.totalReserves();
    console.log("totalReserves (wBTC)            :", totalReserves);

    // Fetch initial borrow balance
    uint initialBorrowBalance = cWbtcDelegator.borrowBalanceCurrent(alice);

    {

    uint secs = 86_400;
    uint period = 10;

    // vm.warp(block.timestamp + secs);
    // cWbtcDelegator.accrueInterest(); 

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < secs / period; ++i) {
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + period);
        cWbtcDelegator.accrueInterest(); // Accrue interest on the wBTC market
    }

    console.log("");
    console.log(secs, "sec passed");
    console.log("");

    }

    // Fetch updated borrow balance
    uint updatedBorrowBalance = cWbtcDelegator.borrowBalanceCurrent(alice);

    // Calculate accrued interest
    uint interestAccrued = updatedBorrowBalance - initialBorrowBalance;
    console.log("Borrower interest accrued (wBTC):", interestAccrued);

    uint updatedTotalReserves = cWbtcDelegator.totalReserves();
    console.log("totalReserves (wBTC)            :", updatedTotalReserves);

    vm.stopPrank();
}

```

Output when test is run with the `accrueInterest` called once per 10 seconds for 1 day:
```bash
$ forge test --match-test test_accrueInterest_PoC -vvv
Ran 1 test for test/CToken.t.sol:CTokenTest
[PASS] test_accrueInterest_PoC() (gas: 141057857)
Logs:
  Utilization Rate (%)           : 5
  totalReserves (wBTC)           : 0

  86400 sec passed

  Borrower interest accrued (wBTC): 21404
  totalReserves (wBTC)           : 0

```
As can be seen, reserves were not increased and stayed at 0.
At the same time, a real `totalReserves` increase must be `21404 * 0.3 = 6421`.

## Impact

Market (CToken) may not accrue total reserves.

Preconditions:
- High volume of transactions (once every 10 to 15 seconds).
- Market utilization rate is no more than 5 - 10 %.

## Recommendation

Do not update `accrualBlockTimestamp` if calculations result in zero.
