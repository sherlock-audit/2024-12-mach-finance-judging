# Lack of confidence intervals checks for Pyth price feed

### Summary

Pyth price feeds specify uncertainty of the returned price. As per the official [docs](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#confidence-intervals) of Pyth Price Feeds, utilizing this confidence interval is recommended for enhanced security.

### Root Cause

Confidence of Pyth price feed is ignored:
```solidity
        PythStructs.Price memory pythPrice = pyth.getPriceUnsafe(priceFeedId);

        uint256 price = uint256(uint64(pythPrice.price));
        uint256 expo = uint256(uint32(-pythPrice.expo));

        return (price, expo);
```

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

A malicious user could exploit invalid prices for particular tokens OR an honest user could suffer due to utilizing a Pyth oracle with poor confidence suffering a loss of funds. 

Even though the owner can change the order of the oracles in `tokenToOracleSources` when Pyth oracle returns an incorrect price, users before this change will suffer losses before that happens.

### Mitigation

Verify the confidence interval as advised in the [docs](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#confidence-intervals
