# Incorrect Calculation of nextTotalSupplies Due to getCashPrior Subtracting msg.value

### Summary

The [getCashPrior function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-mach-finance/blob/main/contracts/src/CSonic.sol#L159-L161) for CSonic is responsible for returning the available cash balance of the contract. It subtracts the `msg.value` (representing the Ether sent in the current transaction) from the contract’s balance (address(this).balance). However, this subtraction is incorrect and leads to underreporting of the balance under the following scenarios:
- Ether Not Yet Processed: The msg.value from the current transaction has not yet been added to the contract’s balance in certain flows.
- Double-Counting Misassumption: Other parts of the codebase (like [mintAllowed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-mach-finance/blob/main/contracts/src/Comptroller.sol#L261-L263)) assume `getCashPrior` accounts for mintAmount automatically when the underlying asset is Ether. This assumption is invalid with the current logic.

### Root Cause

- The msg.value is subtracted from address(this).balance in getCashPrior.
- mintAllowed assumes getCashPrior includes the mintAmount for native assets like Ether, which is incorrect with the current getCashPrior implementation.

### Impact

If the underlying asset is Ether (native asset), `mintAllowed` assumes `getCashPrior` already includes mintAmount and skips adding it, the supply cap check is effectively bypassed for the amount within the transaction without enforcing the supply cap check for native asset (CSonic)

### Mitigation

Explicitly Handle mintAmount in mintAllowed
```solidity
if (_getUnderlyingAddress(CToken(cToken)) == nativeAsset) {
    nextTotalSupplies = add_(totalSupplies, mintAmount); // Explicitly add mintAmount
}
```
