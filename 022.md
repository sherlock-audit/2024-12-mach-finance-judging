# `API3Oracle` does not check for stale prices

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-mach-finance/blob/94f707dd94fc13dc0132deaa89c68f53bed306fa/contracts/src/Oracles/API3/API3Oracle.sol#L79

### Summary

The `API3Oracle` contract fetches the latest price using the `read` function from the API3 Proxy but does not validate the freshness of the price by checking the timestamp. As a result, the system may use outdated prices.

### Root Cause

The `_getLatestPrice` function retrieves the price and timestamp from the API3 Proxy but does not implement a staleness check for the returned timestamp. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The `API3Oracle` contract fetches the price from the API3 Proxy using the read function.


### External Pre-conditions

- The API3 Proxy provides stale price data


### Attack Path

1. An attacker ensures the price feed data is outdated or stale.
2. The `API3Oracle` contract fetches the outdated price.
3. The contract uses this stale price for further computations

### Impact

Stale price / Incorrect price calculations.


### PoC

API3 Documentation about the timestamp: [API3 Contract Integration](https://docs.api3.org/dapps/integration/contract-integration.html#using-timestamp)

In the current implementation:
```solidity
    (int224 price,) = api3Proxy.read();
```
The timestamp returned alongside the price is ignored. As per the API3 documentation:
- The timestamp indicates the reported system (off-chain) time and acts as a nonce for preventing replay attacks.
- If this timestamp is outdated (e.g., exceeding a specific heartbeat interval), it may not be reliable for accurate pricing.

### Mitigation

Implement a staleness check for the timestamp returned by the API3 Proxy to ensure the price data is within an acceptable time frame before using it in calculations.
