# PythOracle may return expired prices

### Summary

It is stated in the pyth price oracle referenced by the project (https://api-reference.pyth.network/price-feeds/evm/getPriceUnsafe): "(getPriceUnsafe)This function may return a price from arbitrarily far in the past. It is the caller's responsibility to check the returned publishTime to ensure that the update is recent enough for their use case. If you need the latest price, update the price using updatePriceFeeds() and then call getPrice()."
However, `PythOracle::_getLatestPrice` only receives `price` and `expo` when receiving the return value, and does not receive and check `publishTime`, which may result in an expired price when obtaining the price.

### Root Cause
