# Attacker will redeem tokens at stale prices

### Summary

There are no staleness checks on the pyth oracle used to value tokens, which will lead to attackers using very stale prices at the expense of other participants.

### Root Cause

In [`PythOracle.sol:98`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-mach-finance/blob/94f707dd94fc13dc0132deaa89c68f53bed306fa/contracts/src/Oracles/Pyth/PythOracle.sol#L98), the oracle is using `getPriceUnsafe()` which does not have any staleness checks, and could potentially return the very first oracle value (assuming there have been no updates since then).

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `PriceOracleAggregator` needs to have been configured to use a `PythOracle`

### External Pre-conditions

1. The `PythOracle`'s feed will need to not have been updated recently
2. The market price of the token has moved since the last Pyth feed update

### Attack Path

1. A user that shouldn't be able to redeem tokens, because the price has moved against them, can still redeem, in spite of the liquidity check

### Impact

Protocol insolvency, since the [solvency checks](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-mach-finance/blob/94f707dd94fc13dc0132deaa89c68f53bed306fa/contracts/src/Comptroller.sol#L336-L342) will essentially be bypassed

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use `getPriceNoOlderThan()` and store a max age for each Pyth oracle
