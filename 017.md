# `PythOracle` does not validate price freshness, leading to potential stale prices

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-mach-finance/blob/94f707dd94fc13dc0132deaa89c68f53bed306fa/contracts/src/Oracles/Pyth/PythOracle.sol#L98
### Summary

The `PythOracle` contract does not correctly handle the price returned by the `getPriceUnsafe` function from the Pyth interface. The issue arises because the `publishTime` of the price is not checked, which can result in using stale prices.

### Root Cause

Lack of validation for the `publishTime` of the price returned by the `getPriceUnsafe` function. This function returns the most recent price update without any recency checks, making it possible to use a price that is arbitrarily far in the past.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The `PythOracle` contract calls the `getPriceUnsafe` function to fetch the price.
- The `publishTime` of the returned price is not validated.

### External Pre-conditions

- The price feed data in the Pyth contract contains outdated prices.
- The `PythOracle` contract relies on the price returned by the `getPriceUnsafe` function without additional checks.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker ensures the price feed data is outdated.
2. The `PythOracle` contract fetches this outdated price using the `getPriceUnsafe` function.
3. The contract uses this stale price for further calculations, leading to incorrect outcomes.

### Impact

Incorrect price calculations / Use of outdated price


### PoC

The Pyth interface clearly advises users to check the `publishTime` to ensure that the price is recent:
```solidity
    /// @notice Returns the price of a price feed without any sanity checks.
    /// @dev This function returns the most recent price update in this contract without any recency checks.
    /// This function is unsafe as the returned price update may be arbitrarily far in the past.
    ///
@>  /// Users of this function should check the `publishTime` in the price to ensure that the returned price is
    /// sufficiently recent for their application. If you are considering using this function, it may be
    /// safer / easier to use `getPriceNoOlderThan`.
    /// @return price - please read the documentation of PythStructs.Price to understand how to use this safely.
    function getPriceUnsafe(
        bytes32 id
    ) external view returns (PythStructs.Price memory price);
```

### Mitigation

The `PythOracle` contract should check the `publishTime` of the returned price to ensure it is not outdated.
