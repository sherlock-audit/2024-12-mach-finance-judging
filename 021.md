# `BandOracle` contract does not check price staleness

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-mach-finance/blob/94f707dd94fc13dc0132deaa89c68f53bed306fa/contracts/src/Oracles/Band/BandOracle.sol#L85

### Summary

The `BandOracle` contract fetches the latest price from the BAND oracle but does not check whether the price is stale by verifying the `lastUpdatedBase` value. This can result in using outdated prices.

### Root Cause

The `BandOracle` contract fetches the price using the `_getLatestPrice` function but does not validate the freshness of the data by checking the `lastUpdatedBase` timestamp. As a result, stale price data can be returned without any warning or error.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The `BandOracle` contract fetches the price from Band Protocol through the `getReferenceData` function

### External Pre-conditions

- The Band Protocol price feed is active and provides price data for tokens.
- The price data is stale, as demonstrated by the real example in the PoC section, where the price is significantly outdated.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker ensures the price feed data is outdated.
2. The contract fetches this outdated price.
3. The contract uses the stale price for further calculations or decisions.

### Impact

Stale price / Incorrect price calculations

### PoC

For example, consider this BTC-USD price feed from [FTMScan Band Oracle contract](https://ftmscan.com/address/0xDA7a001b254CD22e46d3eAB04d937489c93174C3#readContract), where the contract returns a price for BTC/USD at the time of writing the report: 
* `rate: 95746094876837000000000` ($95,746 per BTC, while the current price is $100,064 per BTC)
* `lastUpdatedBase: 1733242882` (December 3, 2024)
* `lastUpdatedQuote: 1734624048` (December 19, 2024)

These values show that the price is outdated (more than 15 days) and could result in using stale prices in the system.

### Mitigation

Implement the necesarry checks to ensure the timestamp values are within an acceptable time frame before using the price data.
