# Pyth `expo` value is not handled correctly.

### Summary

The `expo` value returned by Pyth oracles is related to the decimals of the returned price. Currently, the implementation always assumes `expo` is negative. However, if `expo` is positive, the protocol will fail to fetch the price correctly.

### Root Cause

If expo is positive, then [this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-mach-finance/blob/94f707dd94fc13dc0132deaa89c68f53bed306fa/contracts/src/Oracles/Pyth/PythOracle.sol#L101) line will incorrectly calculate the decimals due to overflow.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None needed

### External Pre-conditions

1. Pyth oracle expo value is positive

### Attack Path

As stated in the official Pyth network [docs](https://api-reference.pyth.network/price-feeds/evm/getPriceUnsafe), the `expo` value returned from the `getPriceUnsafe` function represents the decimal precision of the returned price. This `expo` value can be either negative or positive.

If the returned `expo` is negative, the following line in [PythOracle.sol:151](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-mach-finance/blob/94f707dd94fc13dc0132deaa89c68f53bed306fa/contracts/src/Oracles/Pyth/PythOracle.sol#L101) will get an extra big value because converting negative values to uint will start from the last bit.

### Impact

The protocol will fail to fetch the price due to unsafe casting from `int` to `uint`, causing the function to revert due to "0" price. This can be especially problematic during periods of high market activity when price updates are critical. If the admin doesnâ€™t act quickly to change the oracle address, some liquidations may be delayed, potentially resulting in bad debt.

### PoC

If the `expo` returned from `getPriceUnsafe` is `1`, casting it as `uint32(-1)` will result in `2^32 - 1`, which is an extremely large value. Consequently, the `scale` will also be a massive number, and the `scaledPrice` will evaluate to `0`, causing the price to be incorrectly reported.  

```solidity
uint256 scale = 10 ** (feedDecimals + decimals - PRICE_SCALE);
scaledPrice = price / scale;
```
