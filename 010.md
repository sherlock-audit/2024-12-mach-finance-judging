- **Admin Control:** The admin possesses the authority to modify the implementation contract through the `_setImplementation` function. This capability allows the admin to change the contract's behaviour entirely, posing a centralisation risk.

- **Potential for Abuse:** If the admin account is compromised or acts maliciously, it could replace the implementation with a harmful contract, adversely affecting all users.

- **Single Point of Failure:** The admin role represents a single point of failure, introducing significant risks if not adequately secured.

### Mitigation

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Multi-Signature Wallet:** Employ a multi-signature wallet for the admin role to distribute control and mitigate the risk of a single point of failure.

- **Timelocks:** Implement timelocks on critical functions, such as `_setImplementation`, to provide users with time to respond to changes.

- **Governance:** Consider adopting a decentralised governance mechanism to oversee contract upgrades.
