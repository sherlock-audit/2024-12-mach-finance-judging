# Lack of protection against price selection in Pyth pull oracle model

### Summary
The Pyth Network's pull oracle model allows users to select prices for transactions, which can lead to them to choose the favor prices to operates on-chain. 

**Currently, the Pyth Network operates as a first-priority protocol but lacks crucial validation of the data returned from the Pyth price feed.**

[PythOracle._getLatestPrice()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-mach-finance/blob/main/contracts/src/Oracles/Pyth/PythOracle.sol#L93-L104)
```solidity
function _getLatestPrice(address token) internal view returns (uint256, uint256) {
    // Return 0 if price feed id is not set, reverts are handled by caller
    if (priceFeedIds[token] == bytes32(0)) return (0, 0);

    bytes32 priceFeedId = priceFeedIds[token];
    PythStructs.Price memory pythPrice = pyth.getPriceUnsafe(priceFeedId);

    uint256 price = uint256(uint64(pythPrice.price));
    uint256 expo = uint256(uint32(-pythPrice.expo));

    return (price, expo);
}
```
### Root Cause


The Pyth oracle operates on a pull model, allowing users to select prices that favor their transactions by callin [`PYTH.updatePriceFeeds()`](https://vscode.blockscan.com/ethereum/0xdd24f84d36bf92c65f92307595335bdfab5bbd21) (This function an be called by anyone engaging with the oracle)

In this model, Pyth uses off-chain sources to fetch the latest prices and submit them on-chain. While this allows participants to update prices on-chain, it also introduces the risk of users racing to use prices that benefit them.

* [Adversarial selection](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#adversarial-selection) 
> Pull updates give users of Pyth Network some ability to select which price to use in a transaction. This ability is highly circumscribed by various constraints: on-chain prices must move forward in time and cannot be from too far in the past. However, users can still choose any price update that satisfies these constraints. This ability is functionally equivalent to latency: it allows users to see the price in the future before using a price from the past.

* *[Latency](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#latency), 
> The threat model for integrating protocols should assume that adversaries see price changes a short time before the protocol does. In this threat model, protocol designers should avoid situations where a Pyth price update must race against an adversary's transaction. Adversaries are highly likely to win these races ...

Using the price without stringent checks opens the door for exploitation through price selection, especially for high-latency protocols that are sensitive to price fluctuations.

Furthermore, the Compound market model, which calculates hypothetical account liquidity through all available assets, also allows users to choose to update the price for specific collateral tokens or leave it non-updated to use a more favorable approach.

```solidity
function getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityInternal(
    address account,
    MToken mTokenModify,
    uint redeemTokens,
    uint borrowAmount) internal view returns (Error, uint, uint) {

    AccountLiquidityLocalVars memory vars; // Holds all our calculation results
    uint oErr;

    // For each asset the account is in
    MToken[] memory assets = accountAssets[account];
    for (uint i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) {
        MToken asset = assets[i];

        --- SNIPPED ---

        // Get the normalized price of the asset
        vars.oraclePriceMantissa = oracle.getUnderlyingPrice(asset);
        if (vars.oraclePriceMantissa == 0) {
            return (Error.PRICE_ERROR, 0, 0);
        }
        vars.oraclePrice = Exp({mantissa: vars.oraclePriceMantissa});

        --- SNIPPED ---
    }

    // These are safe, as the underflow condition is checked first
    if (vars.sumCollateral > vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects) {
        return (Error.NO_ERROR, vars.sumCollateral - vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects, 0);
    } else {
        return (Error.NO_ERROR, 0, vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects - vars.sumCollateral);
    }
}
```
### Internal pre-conditions

The price update must adhere to the constraints of the Pyth model: on-chain prices must move forward in time and cannot be from too far in the past.


### External pre-conditions

The protocol is particularly vulnerable when integrating with highly volatile assets or operating in high-volatility markets.

### Attack Path:

1. A liquidator or borrower monitors price update transactions from Pyth or uses off-chain methods to fetch updated prices.
2. They select a price that maximizes their benefit within the allowed constraints. For example: 
   - A liquidator artificially inflates the collateral value to initiate liquidation.  
   - A borrower suppresses the collateral value to avoid liquidation or increase borrowing power.  

### Impact

When someone can submit price updates that work entirely in their favor, it creates an incorrect calculations in crucial operation and unfair system. 

They can puts lenders at risk with boosting their collateral value or reduce their debt unfairly, avoiding liquidations or borrowing more than they should. 

To note that currently the protocol decide to use the following price feeds, which can osidered not high volatily asset so it likely being Medium.
```markdown
$USDC (Wormhole / LayerZero)
$FTM / $S
$ETH (Wormhole / LayerZero)
$wBTC (Wormhole / LayerZero)
``` 

### Mitigation (optional)
Consider applying latency mitigations as outlined in [Latency Mitigations for Derivative Protocols](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#latency-mitigations-for-derivative-protocols).

One approach that can simple apply is add more validation checks for the **confidential interval returned** when getting the price, and please not to always check the freshness of the price with the suitable threshold before it is being used.

However, it is somewhat inefficient to require an update for every main operation in the protocol that involves calling `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityInternal()`. Since Pyth requires the caller to pay a fee for every update, looping through this process could result in excessive gas consumption. Thus, the recommendation is to perform the necessary checks before proceeding with the transaction.
