# Missing fallback function

# Vulnerability
The `Unitroller.sol` contract includes a payable fallback function that forwards `msg.data` to `comptrollerImplementation`. However, the `Comptroller.sol` file does not implement a fallback or `receive()` function.

## Mitigation

To address the issue with the payable fallback function, consider the following recommendations:

1. **Restrict Ether Transfers**: If the `comptrollerImplementation` is not intended to handle Ether, restrict the `Unitroller.sol` fallback function from being payable. This can be done by removing the `payable` keyword from the fallback function. This will prevent accidental Ether transfers to the contract.

2. **Implement a Receive Function**: If the contract is expected to handle Ether, ensure that the `comptrollerImplementation` includes a `receive()` function to handle Ether transfers explicitly. This will make the contract's behaviour more predictable and secure.

3. **Explicit Error Handling**: If Ether should not be sent to the contract, consider adding a mechanism to revert transactions that include Ether, providing a clear error message to the sender.

By implementing these recommendations, you can ensure that the contract's behaviour aligns with its intended use and prevent potential issues related to unexpected Ether transfers.
