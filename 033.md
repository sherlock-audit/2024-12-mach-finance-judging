# Using stale price in PythOracle.sol

## Summary

Using `getPriceUnsafe()` without checking `publishTime` may lead to incorrect asset pricing.

## Vulnerability Detail

As can be seen from the snippet below, `PythOracle.sol` calls `getPriceUnsafe()` to get the asset price.

```solidity
        bytes32 priceFeedId = priceFeedIds[token];
        PythStructs.Price memory pythPrice = pyth.getPriceUnsafe(priceFeedId);
```

However, from the Pyth documentation, this can lead to using arbitrarily old prices:

>This method returns the price object containing last updated price for the requested price feed ID.
>**This function may return a price from arbitrarily far in the past.** It is the caller's responsibility to check the returned `publishTime` to ensure that the update is recent enough for their use case.

## Impact

Arbitrarily stale prices may open the door to manipulations and funds loss due to arbitrage.

## Recommendation

Check `publishTime` from the returned `PythStructs.Price` struct. Alternatively, use `getPriceNoOlderThan()` method.
